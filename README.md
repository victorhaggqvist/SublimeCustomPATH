# CustomPATH
Inject custom path's in the Subilme Text's $PATH (or technicaly the plugin containers' $PATH, but that is usualy good enough).

## Settings
```js
{
    // if true, Sublimes system path will be overridden with the custom path
    "override": false,
    // if true, the path will be appended at the front
    "append_front": false,
    // your custom path, on $PATH syntax aka. /path/one:/path/two:/path/n
    "PATH":"/example/bin"
}
```
